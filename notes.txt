//IN javascript, one would be able to set different types to the same state.
    In typescript, it wouldn't be possible
    Typescript 

//useState pieces of state have an inherent type of never.
    //never types are a return type that is usually assigned to functions in instances when errors
      are thrown in said function
    //In an instance where onee expects to initialize functions based on the useState expected value,
      if the value is not set upon initialization, it's best to declare the type of the useState piece of state.
    //This can be done either in line withing angle braces: "<>" or by initially declaring the type and passing it
      into the angle braces.
